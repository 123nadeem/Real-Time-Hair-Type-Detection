# Real-Time-Hair-Type-Detection
This project implements a real-time hair type detection system using a YOLOv8 model. The model classifies different hair types—such as straight, wavy, curly, kinky, and dreadlocks—on live webcam feeds. Bounding boxes and confidence-labeled hair type annotations are displayed directly on the video feed.
